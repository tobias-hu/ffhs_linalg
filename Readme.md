# FFHS LinAlg

This repository was made to store some code of my semester paper at LinAlg (Linear Algebra) at FFHS.

If you came by by chance and you think you could use some of this: feel free!
If you will mention me when you're using my code, that would be nice.

If you want to, you could [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/toebu) ðŸ˜‰



## Table of contents
### Teil 1
is about central projection of a parallelepiped. The object is placed in a threedimensional coordinate system. You can set the origin of the object but it has to be in the first octant.

Then you can choose the camera position and the application will show you how the spat will be projected to the xy-level with your given coordinates.


### Teil 2
Is about Hamming-Codes
